# Sample Audio Files

This directory contains sample call recordings that demonstrate the AI voice agent in action. These files would typically be actual audio recordings in .mp3 or .wav format, but for this demonstration, we're including this README as a placeholder.

In a production environment, these would include:

1. `appointment_scheduling.mp3` - Example of the AI scheduling a new appointment
2. `faq_answering.mp3` - Example of the AI answering common questions
3. `lead_qualification.mp3` - Example of the AI qualifying a potential new client
4. `multilingual_demo.mp3` - Example of the AI handling a call in Spanish

These audio files would be referenced in the Solution component to let potential customers hear the AI voice agent in action.
