# AgenticVoice.net Research Summary

## Project Overview

AgenticVoice.net is being developed as a service-oriented platform for creating and managing AI voice agents, primarily targeting doctors, lawyers, and sales professionals. The platform leverages Vapi.ai technology to provide voice-based AI employees that can handle tasks such as appointment scheduling, sales calls, and customer interactions.

## Key Research Findings

### 1. Business Model

- **Service-First Approach**: The platform will operate primarily as a service company where the AgenticVoice team builds the voice agents, with customers having limited management control.
- **Target Industries**: Initially focusing on medical practices, legal firms, and sales organizations.
- **Value Proposition**: Reducing administrative costs, saving time on routine tasks, increasing client satisfaction, and reducing missed appointments.

### 2. Technical Foundation

- **Core Technology**: Built on Vapi.ai platform, which provides:
  - Speech-to-text (STT) capabilities
  - Language model (LLM) integration
  - Text-to-speech (TTS) functionality
  - Real-time call handling
  - Web and phone call capabilities

- **Integration Capabilities**: 
  - n8n.io workflows for automation (built by the AgenticVoice team)
  - Potential integrations with marketing and sales tools (vibe.co, growads.com, apollo.io, apify.com, instantly.ai)

- **Authentication**: 
  - Google OAuth
  - Magic links (already implemented in codebase)

### 3. UI Framework & Components

- **Current Implementation**:
  - Next.js framework
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - DaisyUI for theme components
  - Custom animations and transitions

- **Planned Enhancements**:
  - Integration of 21st.dev components
  - MagicUI components for animated elements and micro-interactions
  - shadcn/ui as a complementary component library

### 4. Existing Brand Elements

- **Logo**: Available in the public directory as logoAndName.png
- **Color Scheme**: Gradient-based with colors ranging from orange to blue-green:
  ```
  linear-gradient(60deg, #f79533, #f37055, #ef4e7b, #a166ab, #5073b8, #1098ad, #07b39b, #6fba82)
  ```
- **Animations**: Several custom animations defined in tailwind.config.js:
  - opacity
  - appearFromRight
  - wiggle
  - popup
  - shimmer

### 5. User Requirements

- **Mobile Support**: Full mobile functionality required
- **Multilingual Support**: Required for interface
- **Timeline**: Aggressive (one week for completion)
- **User Control**: Limited customer control over workflows (visualizations only)

## Vapi.ai Platform Capabilities

### Core Features

1. **Assistant Creation & Management**:
   - Create and configure voice assistants
   - Set system prompts and personalities
   - Configure LLM, STT, and TTS models

2. **Call Handling**:
   - Inbound calls (customers call the assistant)
   - Outbound calls (assistant calls customers)
   - Web-based calls

3. **Phone Number Management**:
   - Create free numbers
   - Import existing numbers from providers
   - Attach numbers to assistants

4. **API & SDK Integration**:
   - Comprehensive REST API
   - Web SDK for browser integration
   - Various client SDKs (iOS, Flutter, React Native, etc.)

### Technical Integration Points

1. **Web SDK Implementation**:
   ```javascript
   import Vapi from "@vapi-ai/web";
   
   // Initialize with public key or JWT
   const vapi = new Vapi("YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY");
   
   // Start a call with an assistant
   const call = await vapi.start("assistant-id");
   
   // Event handling
   vapi.on("call-start", () => console.log("Call started"));
   vapi.on("call-end", () => console.log("Call ended"));
   ```

2. **API Authentication**:
   - Bearer token authentication
   - JWT authentication option

3. **Webhook Integration**:
   - Phone Number Hooks for call events
   - Custom message handling

## Avatar Research Insights

The repository contains detailed avatar research for target customers, specifically focusing on medical professionals like Dr. Michael Brenner, an orthopedic surgeon. This research includes:

1. **Problem-Aware Customer Avatar**: Detailed profile of target customers and their pain points
2. **Emotional Insights**: First-person narrative of customer frustrations and needs
3. **ROI Justification**: Pricing models and return on investment calculations
4. **Marketing Approach**: High-converting landing page structure using Magic UI components

## Next Steps

Based on the research findings, the project will proceed with:

1. Defining a comprehensive brand identity and design system
2. Creating detailed specifications for each required page
3. Designing mermaid.js diagrams for key concepts and flows
4. Compiling all specifications into numbered markdown files
