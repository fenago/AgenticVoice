# Dear Diary Entry - Dr. Michael Brenner

Dear Diary,

Another day, another administrative nightmare. I just got home after a 12-hour day—seven surgeries followed by two hours of returning phone calls that my staff couldn't get to. My shoulders ache, my head is pounding, and I'm missing Tyler's baseball game. Again. 

The irony isn't lost on me. I can repair complex joint injuries with precision that amazes even my colleagues, yet I can't figure out how to fix the broken communication system in my own practice. Today, Jessica (my office manager) left a stack of pink message slips on my desk with an apologetic look that said everything without saying anything. Thirty-seven missed calls. Thirty-seven! Each one representing a patient need, a potential new referral, or worse—an existing patient who couldn't reach us for a post-op concern.

I keep staring at the ceiling, calculating the cost of these inefficiencies. If even five of those calls were new patients, that's potentially $50,000 in revenue walking out the door. But it's not just about the money. It's about failing the very people who trust me with their health. Mrs. Abernathy called three times today trying to get clarification on her pre-op instructions for tomorrow's procedure. She finally got through at 4:45 PM, anxiety evident in her voice. That's not the patient experience I've worked fifteen years to create.

The weight of it sits on my chest like a boulder. I built this practice from nothing—sleepless nights, missed family dinners, sacrifices that Sarah and the kids never signed up for but endured anyway. Now it's thriving by every medical metric, yet drowning in operational chaos. The surgical side is a well-oiled machine; the administrative side is held together with duct tape and the heroic efforts of an increasingly burned-out staff.

Jessica hinted today that she's considering a position at the new multi-specialty clinic across town. "Less stress, Dr. Brenner," she said, not meeting my eyes. I can't blame her. I've watched her field the same questions about office hours, insurance, and directions a dozen times a day, each interruption pulling her away from more important tasks. Her medical assistant training is wasted on these repetitive interactions.

That answering service I hired last year was supposed to fix this. $800 a month down the drain. Patients hate it—they want answers, not promises that someone will call them back "within 24 business hours." And that phone system upgrade? Fifteen thousand dollars for what amounts to a slightly more sophisticated way to put people on hold.

I saw an article in Medscape last week about AI technology in healthcare administration. Initially, I dismissed it as another tech fad that wouldn't translate to real-world practice needs. But tonight, lying here with the day's failures fresh in my mind, I'm wondering if I've been too quick to judge. Dr. Patel mentioned at last month's orthopedic conference that he implemented some kind of virtual assistant for his practice phone lines. I nodded politely at the time, but didn't ask for details. Pride, probably. Or fear of appearing technologically inept.

The practice down the street—the one with the young orthopedist barely five years out of residency—has a sleek website with online scheduling and some kind of chat feature. Their waiting room is always full. Meanwhile, I'm losing patients to voicemail hell and missed connections.

Sarah came in earlier, concern etched on her face. "You need to delegate more," she said, the same advice she's been giving for years. But that's just it—I have no one left to delegate to. Everyone is already stretched thin. Hiring another person means more salary, more benefits, more training time, and no guarantee they won't be overwhelmed by the same systemic problems within months.

I keep thinking about Mrs. Delgado, who switched to another practice last month after being with me for eight years. "It just became too difficult to reach your office, Dr. Brenner," she explained apologetically. "I called three times about my knee pain and never heard back." I wanted to explain that we did call back—once—and left a voicemail she never received. But excuses don't heal patients or build practices.

The anxiety keeps building. Every unanswered call, every frustrated patient, every overwhelmed staff member is a crack in the foundation of what I've built. I'm watching my life's work slowly erode due to something that seems so fixable, yet continues to elude me.

Tomorrow I have back-to-back surgeries until 3 PM, then a staff meeting where I'm supposed to present solutions, not just acknowledge problems. Jessica has prepared an agenda that includes "communication workflow improvements" as the first item. My stomach knots just thinking about it. What am I going to say? That I spent $45,000 on solutions that didn't work, and I'm fresh out of ideas?

I need to find a way to handle these calls that doesn't involve throwing more bodies at the problem. Something that works seamlessly with our existing systems. Something that doesn't require me to become an IT expert on top of everything else I'm responsible for. Something that actually solves the problem instead of just shifting it around.

The frustration is suffocating. I've conquered far more complex challenges in the OR. Why is this administrative issue defeating me? Every day I walk the tightrope between delivering exceptional medical care and running a business, and lately, it feels like I'm one missed call away from falling.

I keep coming back to what Dr. Topol said in his keynote last year: "The future of healthcare isn't just about medical innovation—it's about operational innovation." At the time, it sounded like consultant-speak. Now it feels prophetic.

I'm going to call Dr. Patel tomorrow and swallow my pride. I need to know more about whatever solution he's implemented. If there's technology out there that can answer patient calls, schedule appointments, provide basic information, and escalate urgent matters—all without adding to my overhead or creating more work for my staff—I need to know about it.

Because I can't keep staring at the ceiling, calculating losses, and missing my son's baseball games.

Something has to change.
