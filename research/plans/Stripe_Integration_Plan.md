# Stripe Payments Integration Plan

This document outlines the plan to integrate Stripe payments into the AgenticVoice application, allowing users to subscribe to various plans.

**Objective:** Enable the site to accept credit card payments for subscriptions.

### Phase 1: Configuration and Verification

*   **Objective:** Ensure the application is correctly configured to communicate with Stripe and reflects the complete and updated plan structure.
*   **Step 1: Environment Variables:**
    *   Add `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_ESSENTIAL` to `.env.example`.
    *   Ensure all Stripe keys and Price IDs are populated in `.env.local`.
*   **Step 2: Application Config (`config.ts`):**
    *   Add the new "Essential" plan to the `config.ts` file.
    *   Update the feature lists for all existing plans in `config.ts` to match the detailed descriptions in `voice_agent_pricing.md`.
*   **Step 3: Backend API Review:**
    *   Re-confirm that the existing API endpoints (`/api/stripe/create-checkout` and `/api/webhooks/stripe`) are robust enough to handle the new plan without modification.

### Phase 2: Frontend Implementation and User Flow

*   **Objective:** Create a clear, user-facing interface for selecting and purchasing any of the available plans.
*   **Step 4: Pricing Page UI:**
    *   Find and update the existing pricing component to dynamically render all subscription plans from the updated `config.ts`.
    *   The UI must clearly display the title, price, and the detailed list of features for each plan.
*   **Step 5: Checkout Button Integration:**
    *   Each plan on the pricing page will have a "Subscribe" or "Get Started" button that initiates the Stripe Checkout process for that specific plan.

### Phase 3: Testing and Finalization

*   **Objective:** Perform an end-to-end test of the entire payment flow for all plans.
*   **Context:** All testing will be conducted in Stripe's **test/sandbox mode**.
*   **Step 6: Webhook Testing:**
    *   Use the Stripe CLI to forward webhooks to the local development server to test post-payment actions (like updating a user's role in the database).
*   **Step 7: End-to-End Test Scenario:**
    *   Test the full subscription flow for all plans, especially the new "Essential" plan.
    *   Verify that a user's account in the database is updated correctly after a successful test payment.
*   **Step 8: Customer Portal:**
    *   Ensure a logged-in, subscribed user can access the Stripe Customer Portal to manage their subscription.
